# SmartPiggyBank

Hi,

Our Capstone Project that Smart Piggy Bank provides security, convenience and savings to all age groups. The coins that the
user places on the A5 plate are detected by the camera we use and the results are delivered to the user through the mobile
application. For security, the user cannot make transactions unless he/she is logged in to his/her account from the mobile
application and opens the case cover from within the application.

Used Technologies: For the mobile application, Java is used in Android Studio. Python language is used in Raspberry Pi for
triggering servo motors and image processing. Firebase was used for data processing.

2018-2019 academic year in the Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences Capstone Project Competition
"Competitive Project" First place in the branch

NOTE: Firebase was used for data processing so, The file "google-services.json" was not added because the API key appears. Therefore, the application may not work correctly.
